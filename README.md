# Machine Learning in Astronomy

A study of machine learning applications in sky surveys, reproducible
research, and open scientific collaboration.

This organization develops methods and infrastructure for applying
modern machine learning techniques to large-scale astronomical survey
data, including imaging, catalogs, and cross-matched multi-survey
datasets.
