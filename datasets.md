## Background

The datasets are constructed using the Rubin Science Platform, which is
a software stack developed for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The Rubin
Science Platform provides tools and infrastructure for data processing,
analysis, and visualization, enabling researchers to work with large
astronomical datasets efficiently.
